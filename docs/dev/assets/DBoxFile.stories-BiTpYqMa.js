File",component:S,parameters:{docs:{description:{component:`
The DBoxFile component is a drag-and-drop solution for file uploads. It supports preloading images from URLs and allows users to delete uploaded files.
The component's behavior is inspired by the [React Dropzone](https://react-dropzone.js.org/) library.

## Features

- **Drag-and-drop support**: Easily upload files by dragging them into the component.
- **Preloaded files**: Initialize the component with files from URLs.
- **File deletion**: Users can remove uploaded files directly from the interface.
- **Multiple file uploads**: Configurable to accept one or multiple files.
- **File validation**: Supports MIME type and file size validation.
